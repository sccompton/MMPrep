<<ANSWER HERE>>

[1.5] What is encapsulation? (3:45)
-----------------------------------
What does encapsulation prevent? What does it enable?

<<ANSWER HERE>>

[1.6] What is inheritance? (3:35)

Describe the inheritance relationship between classes. When would this
relationship be advantageous to establish?

<<ANSWER HERE>>

[1.7] What is polymorphism? (3:22)
----------------------------------
What is the basic idea behind polymorphism? How can it make the classes we
create more flexible?

<<ANSWER HERE>>


Section 2: Object-Oriented Analysis and Design
==============================================
[2.1] Understanding the object-oriented analysis and design processes (4:13)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
What are the steps of analysis that come before writing code for an application?
Why do you think these steps make writing the code easier?

<<ANSWER HERE>>

[2.2] Defining requirements (6:09)
----------------------------------
What should you have after you've completed the first phase of defining your
requirements?

<<ANSWER HERE>>

[2.3] Introduction to the Unified Modeling Language (UML) (1:54)
----------------------------------------------------------------
What is UML? Why Is it useful to visualize your application before coding it?

<<ANSWER HERE>>

Section 3: Utilizing Use Cases
==============================
[3.1] Understanding use cases (6:11)
------------------------------------
Write a use case for creating an event on your phone's calendar.

<<ANSWER HERE>>

[3.2] Identifying the actors (4:16)
-----------------------------------
Can you think of a use case for a mobile application in which the actor is not
the user of the mobile device?

<<ANSWER HERE>>

[3.3] Identifying the scenarios (5:07)
--------------------------------------
Write another use case for a mobile device user interacting with a calendar
application. This time include a couple extensions when crafting your scenario.

<<ANSWER HERE>>

[3.4] Diagramming use cases (4:18)
----------------------------------
Do a google image search for "use case diagram." Notice how many variations
there are. What do they all generally have in common?

<<ANSWER HERE>>

[3.5] Employing user stories (3:43)
-----------------------------------
Write 5 user stories to describe a mobile user interacting with his or her maps
application.

<<ANSWER HERE>>


Section 4: Domain Modeling (Modeling the App)
=============================================
[4.1] Creating a conceptual model (1:59)
----------------------------------------
What’s your favorite color?

<<ANSWER HERE>>

[4.2] Identifying the classes (2:27)
------------------------------------
Identify the classes in the use case you constructed for a user interacting with
his or her calendar application in chapter 3.

<<ANSWER HERE>>

[4.3] Identifying class relationships (2:38)
--------------------------------------------
Identify the relationships among the classes you found above. Create a
conceptual model where you diagram these relationships and then upload a picture
of your model below.

<<ANSWER HERE>>

[4.4] Identifying class responsibilities (6:43)
-----------------------------------------------
Identify the responsibilities of the classes you found above. List them here.

<<ANSWER HERE>>

[4.5] Using CRC cards (2:49)
----------------------------
If you’d like, try creating CRC cards for the model you made above. There's no
need to respond here, just try it out and see if you like this form of
organization.

<<ANSWER HERE… IF YOU LIKE>>


Section 5: Creating Classes
===========================
[5.1] Creating class diagrams (6:11)
------------------------------------
Construct Class Diagrams for the classes you imagine exist in a twitter app, a
maps app, a calendar app, or any other app you would like to make. Do you find
that it is easier to come up with the attributes or with the behaviors? Why do
you think that is?

<<ANSWER HERE>>

[5.2] Converting class diagrams to code (4:57)
----------------------------------------------
How might the separation of interface and implementation in Objective-C be an
advantage when working with class diagrams?

<<ANSWER HERE>>

[5.3] Exploring object lifetime (5:55)
--------------------------------------
What are the constructors and destructors in Objective-C? Why do we use them?

<<ANSWER HERE>>

[5.4] Using static or shared members (5:22)
-------------------------------------------
Like the interest rate example in the video, give three additional examples of
data that would be the same for all instances of a class.

<<ANSWER HERE>>


Section 6: Inheritance and Composition
======================================
6.1 Identifying inheritance situations (6:49)
---------------------------------------------
Describe in your own words what inheritance is and how it is useful when
constructing classes.

<<ANSWER HERE>>

[6.2] Using inheritance (2:43)
------------------------------
Referring to the apps on your phone, come up with three examples where you
believe methods are being inherited from superclasses and called by subclasses.

<<ANSWER HERE>>
